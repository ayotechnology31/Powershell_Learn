Exercise - Create a pipeline and format the response
5 minutes
Here you'll run commands to construct powerful statements that pipe cmdlets together. You'll run helper cmdlets and formatting cmdlets to filter for the data you need and to ensure the result is usable.

Discover the most-used processes on your machine
To manage your machine, you sometimes need to discover what processes run on it and how much memory and CPU they consume. This information tells you what the machine spends its resources on. You can use this information to decide whether to introduce new processes on your machine, to leave the machine as it is, or to free up resources by closing resource-intensive processes. The more you know about the processes that run on your machine, the better.

To begin, run the command Get-Process, and pipe in the cmdlets Where-Object and Sort-Object.
Get-Process | Where-Object CPU -gt 100 | Sort-Object CPU -Descending | Select-Object -First 3

The exact output you see depends on your machine, but you should see the first three processes whose CPU value is higher than a 1,000. These processes are sorted in a descending order, with the highest CPU value on top. Your output will look similar to the following example.

    NPM(K)    PM(M)      WS(M)     CPU(s)      Id  SI ProcessName
     ------    -----      -----     ------      --  -- -----------
      0     0.00     100.00 120,000.00    4000   1 some-process-name
      0     0.00     100.00  30,000.66     400   1 some-other-process-name
      0     0.00     100.00  27,000.00     500   1 a-process
      
Compare formatting approaches
Different output formats make sense for different scenarios. Depending on the type of data you're looking for, a table might make more sense than a list, for example.

Some cmdlets use a certain type of formatting by default. You can override the default formatting by using a formatting cmdlet.

1. Run the Get-Member command.
"a string" | Get-Member

        The output is a table that lists all of the members. Here are the first few lines of the output:
            Name                 MemberType            Definition
             ----                 ----------            ----------
             Clone                Method                System.Object Clone(), System.Object ICloneable.Clone()
             CompareTo            Method                int CompareTo(System.Object value), int CompareTo(string strB), int IComparable.CompareTo(…
     
Next, you override the default formatting by using the Format-List cmdlet.


2. Run the Format-List command as you see in the following example.
"a string" | Get-Member | Format-List

The resulting output is a little different from the earlier output. The first few lines of the output response now appear like a list.
        TypeName   : System.String
         Name       : Clone
         MemberType : Method
         Definition : System.Object Clone(), System.Object ICloneable.Clone()

         TypeName   : System.String
         Name       : CompareTo
         MemberType : Method
         Definition : int CompareTo(System.Object value), int CompareTo(string strB), int IComparable.CompareTo(System.Object obj), int 
                      IComparable[string].CompareTo(string other)
