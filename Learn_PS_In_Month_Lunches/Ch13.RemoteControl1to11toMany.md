When we first started to use PowerShell (in version 1), we were playing around with
the Get-Service command and noticed that it had a -computerName parameter.
Hmmm... does that mean it can get services from other computers, too? After a bit
of experimenting, we discovered that’s exactly what it did. We were excited and
started to look for -computerName parameters on other cmdlets. But we were disappointed to find there were only a few. With v2 a few more were added, but the number of commands that have this parameter are vastly outnumbered by the
commands that don’t.
 What we’ve realized since that time is that PowerShell’s creators are a bit lazy—
and that’s a good thing. Because they didn’t want to have to code a -computerName
parameter for every single cmdlet, they created a shell-wide system called remoting.
This system enables you to run any cmdlet on a remote computer. In fact, you can
even run commands that exist on the remote computer but that don’t exist on your
own computer—meaning you don’t always have to install every single administrative cmdlet on your workstation. This remoting system is powerful, and it offers a
number of interesting administrative capabilities.
NOTE Remoting is a huge, complex technology. We’ll introduce you to it
in this chapter and cover usage scenarios that you’ll deal with 80 to 90 percent of the time. But we can’t cover it all, so in the “Further exploration”
section at the end of this chapter, we’ll point you to a must-have resource
that covers remoting’s configuration options.
13.1 The idea behind remote PowerShell
Remote PowerShell works somewhat similarly to Telnet and other age-old remote control technologies. When you run a command, it’s running on the remote computer.
Only the results of that command come back to your computer. But rather than using
Telnet or SSH, PowerShell uses a new communications protocol called Web Services
for Management (WS-MAN).
WS-MAN operates entirely over HTTP or HTTPS, making it easy to route through
firewalls if necessary (because each of those protocols uses a single port to communicate). Microsoft’s implementation of WS-MAN comes in the form of a background service, Windows Remote Management (WinRM). WinRM is installed along with
PowerShell v2 and is started by default on server operating systems like Windows
Server 2008 R2. It’s installed on Windows 7 by default, but the service is disabled. It’s
also included with PowerShell v3, and it’s enabled by default on Windows Server 2012.
 You’ve already learned that Windows PowerShell cmdlets all produce objects as
their output. When you run a remote command, its output objects need to be put into
a form that can be easily transmitted over a network using the HTTP (or HTTPS) protocol. XML, it turns out, is an excellent way to do that, so PowerShell automatically serializes those output objects into XML. The XML is transmitted across the network and is
then deserialized on your computer back into objects that you can work with inside PowerShell. Serialization and deserialization are really just a form of format conversion:
one from objects to XML (serialization), and from XML to objects (deserialization).
 Why should you care how this output is returned? Because those serialized-thendeserialized objects are only snapshots, of sorts; they don’t update themselves continually. For example, if you were to get the objects that represent the processes running on
a remote computer, what you’d get back would only be accurate for the exact point in
time at which those objects were generated. Values like memory usage and CPU utilization won’t be updated to reflect subsequent conditions. In addition, you can’t tell the
deserialized objects to do anything—you can’t instruct one to stop itself, for example.
 Those are basic limitations of remoting, but they don’t stop you from doing some
amazing stuff. In fact, you can tell a remote process to stop itself, but you have to be a
bit clever about it. We’ll show you how later in this chapter.
 To make remoting work, you have two basic requirements:
 Both your computer and the one you want to send commands to must be running Windows PowerShell v2 or v3. Windows XP is the oldest version of Windows on which you can install PowerShell v2, so it’s the oldest version of
Windows that can participate in remoting.
 Ideally, both computers need to be members of the same domain, or of
trusted/trusting domains. It’s possible to get remoting to work outside of a
domain, but it’s tricky, and we won’t be covering it in this chapter. To learn
more about that scenario, open PowerShell and run help about_remote
_troubleshooting.
TRY IT NOW We hope you’ll be able to follow along with some of the examples in this chapter. To participate, you’ll ideally have a second test computer
(or a virtual machine) that’s in the same Active Directory domain as the test
computer you’ve been using up to this point. You can run any version of Windows on that second computer, provided you have PowerShell v2 or v3
installed. If you can’t set up an additional computer or virtual machine, use
“localhost” to create remoting connections to your current computer. You’re
still using remoting, but it isn’t as exciting to be “remote controlling” the
computer at which you’re sitting.
13.2 WinRM overview
Let’s talk a bit about WinRM, because you’re going to have to configure it in order to
use remoting. Once again, you only need to configure WinRM—and PowerShell
remoting—on those computers that will receive incoming commands. In most of the
environments we’ve worked in, the administrators have enabled remoting on every
Windows-based computer (keep in mind that PowerShell and remoting are supported
all the way back to Windows XP). Doing so gives you the ability to remote into client
desktop and laptop computers in the background (meaning the users of those computers won’t know you’re doing so), which can be tremendously useful.
 WinRM isn’t unique to PowerShell. In fact, Microsoft is starting to use it for more
and more administrative communications—even things that use other protocols
today. With that in mind, Microsoft made WinRM able to route traffic to multiple
administrative applications—not only PowerShell. WinRM acts as a dispatcher: when
traffic comes in, WinRM decides which application needs to deal with that traffic. All
WinRM traffic is tagged with the name of a recipient application, and those applications must register as endpoints with WinRM so that WinRM will listen for incoming
traffic on their behalf. This means you’ll not only need to enable WinRM, but you’ll
also need to tell PowerShell to register as an endpoint with WinRM. Figure 13.1 illustrates how the pieces fit together.
 As shown, you can have dozens or even hundreds of WinRM endpoints on your system (PowerShell calls them session configurations). Each endpoint can point to a different application, and you can even have endpoints that point to the same application
but provide different permissions and functionality. For example, you could create a
PowerShell endpoint that only allowed one or two commands, and make it available
to specific users in your environment. We won’t be diving that deep into remoting in
this chapter, but chapter 23 will.
 Figure 13.1 also illustrates the WinRM listener, which in the figure is of the HTTP
variety. A listener sits and waits for incoming network traffic on behalf of WinRM—
kind of like a web server listening for incoming requests. A listener “listens” on a specific port, and on a specific IP address, although the default listener created by
Enable-PSRemoting listens on all local IP addresses.
 The listener connects to the defined endpoint. One way to create an endpoint is to
open a copy of PowerShell—making sure that you’re running it as an Administrator—
