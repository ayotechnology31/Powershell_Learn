Improving your parameterized script

In the previous chapter, we left you with a pretty cool script that had been parameterized. The idea of a parameterized script is that someone else can run the script
without having to worry about, or have to mess with, its contents. They provide
input through a designated interface—parameters—and that’s all they can change.
In this chapter, we’re going to take things a bit further.

22.1 Starting point
Just to make sure we’re on the same page, let’s agree to use listing 22.1 as a starting
point. This script features comment-based help, two input parameters, and a command that uses those input parameters. We’ve made one minor change since the
previous chapter: we changed the output to be selected objects, rather than a formatted table.

Listing 22.1 Starting point: Get-DiskInventory.ps1
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Get-DiskInventory retrieves logical disk information from one or
more computers.
.DESCRIPTION
Get-DiskInventory uses WMI to retrieve the Win32_LogicalDisk
instances from one or more computers. It displays each disk's
drive letter, free space, total size, and percentage of free
Listing 22.1 Starting point: Get-DiskInventory.ps1

space.
.PARAMETER computername
The computer name, or names, to query. Default: Localhost.
.PARAMETER drivetype
The drive type to query. See Win32_LogicalDisk documentation
for values. 3 is a fixed disk, and is the default.
.EXAMPLE
Get-DiskInventory -computername SERVER-R2 -drivetype 3
#>
param (
 $computername = 'localhost',
 $drivetype = 3
)
Get-WmiObject -class Win32_LogicalDisk -computername $computername  
` -filter "drivetype=$drivetype" |
 Sort-Object -property DeviceID |
 Select-Object -property DeviceID,
 @{name='FreeSpace(MB)';expression={$_.FreeSpace / 1MB -as [int]}},
 @{name='Size(GB';expression={$_.Size / 1GB -as [int]}},
 @{name='%Free';expression={$_.FreeSpace / $_.Size * 100 -as [int]}}

Why did we switch to Select-Object instead of Format-Table? We generally feel it’s a
bad idea to write a script that produces preformatted output. After all, if someone
needed this data in a CSV file, and the script was outputting formatted tables, that person would be out of luck. With this revision, we can run our script this way to get a formatted table:

PS C:\> .\Get-DiskInventory | Format-Table
Or we could run it this way to get that CSV file:
PS C:\> .\Get-DiskInventory | Export-CSV disks.csv
The point is that outputting objects (which Select-Object does), as opposed to formatted displays, makes our script more flexible in the long run.

Listing 22.1 Starting point: Get-DiskInventory.ps1

22.2 Getting PowerShell to do the hard work
We’re going to turn on some PowerShell magic by adding just one line to our script.
This technically turns our script into an “advanced script,” which enables a whole slew
of useful PowerShell capabilities. Listing 22.2 shows the revision—we’ve boldfaced the
one new line.
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Get-DiskInventory retrieves logical disk information from one or
more computers.
.DESCRIPTION
Get-DiskInventory uses WMI to retrieve the Win32_LogicalDisk
instances from one or more computers. It displays each disk's
drive letter, free space, total size, and percentage of free
space.

Listing 22.2 Making Get-DiskInventory.ps1 an advanced script

.PARAMETER computername
The computer name, or names, to query. Default: Localhost.
.PARAMETER drivetype
The drive type to query. See Win32_LogicalDisk documentation
for values. 3 is a fixed disk, and is the default.
.EXAMPLE
Get-DiskInventory -computername SERVER-R2 -drivetype 3
#>
[CmdletBinding()]
param (
 $computername = 'localhost',
 $drivetype = 3
)
Get-WmiObject -class Win32_LogicalDisk -computername $computername `
 -filter "drivetype=$drivetype" |
 Sort-Object -property DeviceID |
 Select-Object -property DeviceID,
 @{name='FreeSpace(MB)';expression={$_.FreeSpace / 1MB -as [int]}},
 @{name='Size(GB';expression={$_.Size / 1GB -as [int]}},
 @{name='%Free';expression={$_.FreeSpace / $_.Size * 100 -as [int]}}
It’s important that the [CmdletBinding()] directive be the first line in the script after
the comment-based help. PowerShell only knows to look for it there. With this one
change, the script will continue to run normally, but we’ve enabled several neat features that we’ll explore next.

22.3 Making parameters mandatory
We’re a little unhappy with our script in its existing form because it provides a default
value for the -ComputerName parameter—and we’re not sure one is really needed.
We’d rather prompt for that value than rely on a hardcoded default. Fortunately,
PowerShell makes it easy—again, adding just one line will do the trick, as shown in
listing 22.3.
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Get-DiskInventory retrieves logical disk information from one or
more computers.
.DESCRIPTION
Get-DiskInventory uses WMI to retrieve the Win32_LogicalDisk
instances from one or more computers. It displays each disk's
drive letter, free space, total size, and percentage of free
space.
.PARAMETER computername
The computer name, or names, to query. Default: Localhost.
.PARAMETER drivetype
The drive type to query. See Win32_LogicalDisk documentation
for values. 3 is a fixed disk, and is the default.
.EXAMPLE
Get-DiskInventory -computername SERVER-R2 -drivetype 3
#>
Listing 22.3 Giving Get-DiskInventory.ps1 a mandatory parameter

[CmdletBinding()]
param (
 [Parameter(Mandatory=$True)]
 [string]$computername,
 [int]$drivetype = 3
)
Get-WmiObject -class Win32_LogicalDisk -computername $computername `
 -filter "drivetype=$drivetype" |
 Sort-Object -property DeviceID |
 Select-Object -property DeviceID,
 @{name='FreeSpace(MB)';expression={$_.FreeSpace / 1MB -as [int]}},
 @{name='Size(GB';expression={$_.Size / 1GB -as [int]}},
 @{name='%Free';expression={$_.FreeSpace / $_.Size * 100 -as [int]}}
Just that one decorator, [Parameter(Mandatory=$True)], will make PowerShell prompt
for a computer name if whoever runs this script forgets to provide one. To help PowerShell even further, we’ve given both of our parameters a data type: [string] for
-computername, and [int] (which means integer) for -drivetype.
 Adding these kinds of attributes to parameters can become confusing, so let’s
examine the Param() block syntax more closely—look at figure 22.1.
Above and beyond
When someone runs your script but doesn’t provide a mandatory parameter, PowerShell will prompt them for it. There are two ways to make PowerShell’s prompt more
meaningful to that user.
First, use a good parameter name. Prompting someone to fill in “comp” isn’t as helpful as prompting them to provide a “computerName,” so try to use parameter names
that are descriptive and consistent with what other PowerShell commands use.
You can also add a help message:
[Parameter(Mandatory=$True,HelpMessage="Enter a computer name to query")
Some PowerShell hosts will display that help message as part of the prompt, making
it even clearer to the user, but not every host application will use this attribute, so
don’t be dismayed if you don’t see it all the time as you’re testing. We like including
it anyway, when we’re writing something intended to be used by other people. It never
hurts. But for brevity, we’ll omit HelpMessage from our running example in this chapter.
Figure 22.1 Breaking down
the Param() block syntax

Here are the important things to notice:
 All of the parameters are enclosed within the Param() block’s parentheses.
 A single parameter can consist of multiple decorators, which can either be
strung out on one line, or placed on separate lines as we’ve done in figure 22.1.
We think multiple lines are more readable—but the important bit is that they
all go together. Here, the Mandatory attribute only modifies -computerName—it
has no effect at all on -drivetype.
 Each parameter name except the last one is followed by a comma.
 For better readability, we also like to put a blank line between each parameter.
We think it helps to visually separate them better, making the Param() block less
confusing.
 We define each parameter as if it were a variable—$computername and
$drivetype—but someone who runs this script will treat them as normal PowerShell command-line parameters, such as -computername and -drivetype.
TRY IT NOW Try saving the script in listing 22.3 and running it in the shell.
Don’t specify a -computername parameter and see how PowerShell prompts
you for that information.
22.4 Adding parameter aliases
Is “computername” the first thing that comes to mind when you think about computer
names? Possibly not. We used -computerName as our parameter name because it’s consistent with the way other PowerShell commands are written. Look at Get-Service,
Get-WmiObject, Get-Process, and others, and you’ll see a -computerName parameter
on them all. So we went with that.
 But if something like -hostname comes more easily to your mind, you can add that
as an alternative name, or alias, for the parameter. It’s just another decorator, as
shown in listing 22.4.
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Get-DiskInventory retrieves logical disk information from one or
more computers.
.DESCRIPTION
Get-DiskInventory uses WMI to retrieve the Win32_LogicalDisk
instances from one or more computers. It displays each disk's
drive letter, free space, total size, and percentage of free
space.
.PARAMETER computername
The computer name, or names, to query. Default: Localhost.
.PARAMETER drivetype
The drive type to query. See Win32_LogicalDisk documentation
for values. 3 is a fixed disk, and is the default.
.EXAMPLE
Get-DiskInventory -computername SERVER-R2 -drivetype 3
Listing 22.4 Adding a parameter alias to Get-DiskInventory.ps1

#>
[CmdletBinding()]
param (
 [Parameter(Mandatory=$True)]
 [Alias('hostname')]
 [string]$computername,
 [int]$drivetype = 3
)
Get-WmiObject -class Win32_LogicalDisk -computername $computername `
 -filter "drivetype=$drivetype" |
 Sort-Object -property DeviceID |
 Select-Object -property DeviceID,
 @{name='FreeSpace(MB)';expression={$_.FreeSpace / 1MB -as [int]}},
 @{name='Size(GB';expression={$_.Size / 1GB -as [int]}},
 @{name='%Free';expression={$_.FreeSpace / $_.Size * 100 -as [int]}}
With this minor change, we can now run this:
PS C:\> .\Get-DiskInventory -host SERVER2
NOTE Remember, you only have to type enough of a parameter name for
PowerShell to understand which parameter you meant. In this case, -host was
enough for PowerShell to identify -hostname. We could also have typed the
full thing.
Again, this new addition is a part of the -computername parameter—it has no effect on
-drivetype. The -computername parameter’s definition now occupies three lines of
text, although we could also have strung everything together on one line:
[Parameter(Mandatory=$True)][Alias('hostname')][string]$computername,
We just think that’s a lot harder to read.
22.5 Validating parameter input
Let’s play with the -drivetype parameter a little bit. According to the MSDN documentation for the Win32_LogicalDisk WMI class (do a search for the class name, and
one of the top results will be the documentation), drive type 3 is a local hard disk.
Type 2 is a removable disk, which should also have a size and free space measurement.
Drive types 1, 4, 5, and 6 are less interesting (does anyone use RAM drives, type 6, anymore?), and in some cases they might not have an amount of free space (type 5, for
optical disks). So we’d like to prevent anyone from using those types when they run
our script.
 This listing shows the minor change we need to make.
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Get-DiskInventory retrieves logical disk information from one or
more computers.
.DESCRIPTION
Listing 22.5 Adding parameter validation to Get-DiskInventory.ps1

Get-DiskInventory uses WMI to retrieve the Win32_LogicalDisk
instances from one or more computers. It displays each disk's
drive letter, free space, total size, and percentage of free
space.
.PARAMETER computername
The computer name, or names, to query. Default: Localhost.
.PARAMETER drivetype
The drive type to query. See Win32_LogicalDisk documentation
for values. 3 is a fixed disk, and is the default.
.EXAMPLE
Get-DiskInventory -computername SERVER-R2 -drivetype 3
#>
[CmdletBinding()]
param (
 [Parameter(Mandatory=$True)]
 [Alias('hostname')]
 [string]$computername,
 [ValidateSet(2,3)]
 [int]$drivetype = 3
)
Get-WmiObject -class Win32_LogicalDisk -computername $computername `
 -filter "drivetype=$drivetype" |
 Sort-Object -property DeviceID |
 Select-Object -property DeviceID,
 @{name='FreeSpace(MB)';expression={$_.FreeSpace / 1MB -as [int]}},
 @{name='Size(GB';expression={$_.Size / 1GB -as [int]}},
 @{name='%Free';expression={$_.FreeSpace / $_.Size * 100 -as [int]}}
This new decorator tells PowerShell that only two values, 2 and 3, are accepted by our
-drivetype parameter, and that 3 is the default.
 There are a bunch of other validation techniques you can add to a parameter, and
when it makes sense to do so, you can add more than one to the same parameter. Run
help about_functions_advanced_parameters for a full list—we’ll be sticking with
ValidateSet() for now. Jeffery also did a great set of blog articles on some of the
other “Validate” attributes that might be helpful—you can look it up at http://
jdhitsolutions.com/blog/ (search for “validate”).
TRY IT NOW Save this script and run it again—try specifying -drivetype 5
and see what PowerShell does.
22.6 Adding the warm and fuzzies with verbose output
In chapter 19, we mentioned how we prefer to use Write-Verbose over Write-Host
for producing the step-by-step progress information that some folks like to see their
scripts produce. Now’s the time for a real example.
 We’ve added a few verbose output messages in this listing.
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Get-DiskInventory retrieves logical disk information from one or
Listing 22.6 Adding verbose output to Get-DiskInventory.ps1

more computers.
.DESCRIPTION
Get-DiskInventory uses WMI to retrieve the Win32_LogicalDisk
instances from one or more computers. It displays each disk's
drive letter, free space, total size, and percentage of free
space.
.PARAMETER computername
The computer name, or names, to query. Default: Localhost.
.PARAMETER drivetype
The drive type to query. See Win32_LogicalDisk documentation
for values. 3 is a fixed disk, and is the default.
.EXAMPLE
Get-DiskInventory -computername SERVER-R2 -drivetype 3
#>
[CmdletBinding()]
param (
 [Parameter(Mandatory=$True)]
 [Alias('hostname')]
 [string]$computername,
 [ValidateSet(2,3)]
 [int]$drivetype = 3
)
Write-Verbose "Connecting to $computername"
Write-Verbose "Looking for drive type $drivetype"
Get-WmiObject -class Win32_LogicalDisk -computername $computername `
 -filter "drivetype=$drivetype" |
 Sort-Object -property DeviceID |
 Select-Object -property DeviceID,
 @{name='FreeSpace(MB)';expression={$_.FreeSpace / 1MB -as [int]}},
 @{name='Size(GB';expression={$_.Size / 1GB -as [int]}},
 @{name='%Free';expression={$_.FreeSpace / $_.Size * 100 -as [int]}}
Write-Verbose "Finished running command"
Now try running this script in two ways. This first attempt shouldn’t display any of the
verbose output:
PS C:\> .\Get-DiskInventory -computername localhost
Now for a second attempt, where we want the verbose output displayed:
PS C:\> .\Get-DiskInventory -computername localhost -verbose
TRY IT NOW This is a lot cooler when you see it for yourself—go ahead and
run the script as we’ve shown here, and see the differences for yourself.
How cool is that? When you want verbose output, you can get it—and you
don’t have to code the -Verbose parameter at all! It comes for free when you add
[CmdletBinding()]. And a really neat part is that it will also activate verbose output
for every command that your script contains! So any commands you use that are
designed to produce verbose output will do so automagically. This technique makes it
easy to turn the verbose output on and off, making it a lot more flexible than
Write-Host. And you don’t have to mess around with the $VerbosePreference variable to make the output show up on screen.

 Also, notice in the verbose output how we made use of PowerShell’s double quotation mark trick: by including a variable ($computername) within double quotes, the
output is able to include the contents of the variable, so we can see what PowerShell
is up to.


22.7 Lab
NOTE For this lab, you’ll need any computer running PowerShell v3.
This lab is going to require you to recall some of what you learned in chapter 21,
because you’ll be taking the following command, parameterizing it, and turning it
into a script—just like you did for the lab in chapter 21. But this time we also want you
to make the -computerName parameter mandatory and give it a hostname alias. Have
your script display verbose output before and after it runs this command, too.
Remember, you have to parameterize the computer name—but that’s the only thing
you have to parameterize in this case.
 Be sure to run the command as-is before you start modifying it, to make sure it
works on your system.
get-wmiobject win32_networkadapter -computername localhost |
 where { $_.PhysicalAdapter } |
 select MACAddress,AdapterType,DeviceID,Name,Speed
To reiterate, here’s your complete task list:
 Make sure the command runs as-is before modifying it.
 Parameterize the computer name.
 Make the computer name parameter mandatory.
 Give the computer name parameter an alias, hostname.
 Add comment-based help with at least one example of how to use the script.
 Add verbose output before and after the modified command.
 Save the script as Get-PhysicalAdapters.ps1.
